mojocollab website.

I need to revamp a basic website hosted for free in github pages. It is for a self-corp through which i seek contract opportunities, doing devops, cloud architecture, AI / ML solutions, and overall infrastructure for distributed applications. Broadly, it is technology solutions and consulting services.
Prefer to keep it simple and clean. Want it to seem like it is a modern and successful company (and not just a one-man shop).
The initial version of the website was made using bootstrap. 
Ideally, would like to feed one phase into the AI coding tool and have it execute each substep, run tests verify it meets the requirements and runs successfully, then move on to the next subsetp. 

The end product needs to be something I can continue to host for free using Github Pages.

Let's break this down.

### 1. Feedback on the Existing Website

After reviewing your `index.html`, CSS, and JavaScript files, here is my feedback, keeping in mind your goal to appear as a modern, successful technology consulting company.

**Strengths:**

*   **Good Foundation:** You have a solid, single-page structure that works on mobile devices (thanks to Bootstrap).
*   **Functional Contact Form:** You've correctly identified that a service like Formspree is the right way to handle forms on a static site.
*   **Clear, Simple Navigation:** The navigation is easy to understand and use.

**Areas for Major Improvement:**

*   **Generic Template:** The site uses the "Agency" theme from Start Bootstrap. This is a very popular and recognizable template, which works against your goal of presenting a unique, high-end brand.
*   **Outdated Libraries:** The site is built on Bootstrap 4 and an older version of Font Awesome. Moving to **Bootstrap 5** will provide access to more modern components, remove the dependency on jQuery, and improve performance.
*   **Confusing "Services" Section:** The services listed are very broad ("Consulting," "Web Security"). To attract the right clients, these should be much more specific to your core offerings: **DevOps, Cloud Architecture, and Infrastructure for Distributed Applications.** The descriptions currently read more like a list of personal skills (listing certifications like MCSE) rather than business solutions a company would offer.
*   **Broken Contact Form JavaScript:** This is a critical issue. The `contact_me.js` file is trying to submit the form data to a PHP script (`/assets/mail/contact_me.php`). **This will not work on GitHub Pages**, as it does not support server-side languages like PHP. The simple `form` tag you have pointing to Formspree is the correct approach, but the custom JavaScript is preventing it from working as intended and should be removed.
*   **Lacks a "Success" Narrative:** The site is missing a portfolio or case studies section. For a consulting business, this is the most important section for building trust and proving you can deliver results.
*   **Empty Footer:** The footer is currently empty, which looks unprofessional. It's a valuable space for reinforcing navigation and adding contact details.

### 2. Architecture & Requirements Specification

Here is the plan for the new website.

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **HTML5**
    *   **Bootstrap 5:** We will use the latest version for modern, responsive components. It removes the need for jQuery.
    *   **Custom CSS:** A simple `style.css` file to override Bootstrap defaults and create a unique brand identity.
    *   **JavaScript:** Minimal, vanilla JavaScript for any interactive elements. No jQuery.
    *   **Contact Form:** Use a simple HTML form that submits directly to **Formspree**, removing the unnecessary and non-functional JavaScript validation.
*   **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (Static site only).
*   **Design Principles:**
    *   **Color Palette:** Shift from the bright yellow to a more professional and modern palette. A common choice for tech companies is a dark theme (charcoal/deep blue) with a single, strong accent color (e.g., a vibrant blue, green, or even a more subtle orange).
    *   **Typography:** Use a clean, modern, sans-serif font like Inter, Lato, or stick with Montserrat. Limit the number of fonts to improve performance and consistency.
    *   **Layout:** Clean, spacious, and well-organized with clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Site Structure (Single-Page):**
    *   **`index.html` (Home):** A strong landing page with a clear value proposition, summary of services, and social proof (client logos or testimonials).
    Sections on that single-page:
    *   **`services`:** Detailed descriptions of your core offerings.
    *   **`portfolio`:** Showcase of past projects or case studies.
    *   **`about`:** Company mission, values, and expertise.
    *   **`contact`:** A dedicated, easy-to-use contact page.



a  modern design pattern, often called a "one-page" or "single-page" website.

Switching to a single-page layout is a great choice for your consulting business because:
*   **It tells a story:** You can guide the visitor through a linear narrative: who you are, what you do, proof you're good at it, and how to get in touch.
*   **It's clean and fluid:** The user experience is very smooth, with no page reloads.
*   **It simplifies maintenance:** You only have one primary HTML file to manage.

Let's revise the plan to create a single-page website. The architecture will be simpler, but the phased approach for generating the code is still the best way to ensure quality.

### Revised Architecture & Requirements

*   **Technology Stack:** Unchanged. Bootstrap 5, custom CSS, vanilla JS, and Formspree.
*   **Structure:** A single `index.html` file containing multiple `<section>` elements. Each section will have a unique ID (e.g., `id="services"`) that the navigation bar will link to.
*   **Key Feature:** We will implement "Scrollspy," a Bootstrap feature that automatically highlights the correct navigation link as the user scrolls through the different sections of the page.


Here is the fully revised, single-page website plan that incorporates the new AI/ML service.

### Revised Phased Prompts for a Single-Page Website 

#### Phase 1: Foundation, Navigation, and Core Content

**Goal:** Set up the single page and build the first few critical sections.

*   **Substep 1.1: Project Setup**
    > **Prompt:** "Create a new project for a single-page website. Use the standard Bootstrap 5 boilerplate for the `index.html` file. Create a `css` folder with a blank `style.css` file and an `assets` folder. Ensure you are using Bootstrap 5 and remove any links to jQuery or older JavaScript files like `jqBootstrapValidation.js`."

*   **Substep 1.2: Navigation Bar with Anchor Links**
    > **Prompt:** "In `index.html`, create a responsive, dark Bootstrap 5 navigation bar (`navbar-dark bg-dark`). The brand on the left should say 'Mojo Collaborative'. The navigation links should be anchor links for a single-page layout:
    > *   Home (`#page-top`)
    > *   Services (`#services`)
    > *   Portfolio (`#portfolio`)
    > *   About (`#about`)
    > *   Contact (`#contact`)
    > Add a `js-scroll-trigger` class to each anchor tag."

*   **Substep 1.3: Hero Section**
    > **Prompt:** "Directly below the navigation bar, create a hero section. It should have a dark background. The main headline (h1) should be: **'Scalable Infrastructure for Modern Applications'**. The sub-headline (p class='lead') should be: **'We provide expert DevOps, Cloud Architecture, AI / ML, and Technology Solutions Consulting to drive your business forward.'** Add a primary call-to-action button (`btn btn-primary btn-lg js-scroll-trigger`) that says 'Our Services' and links to the `#services` section."

*   **Substep 1.4: Services Section (Updated with AI/ML)**
    > **Prompt:** "Create a new `<section>` with the `id="services"` and `class="py-5"`. Inside, add a `container`. The section should have a main heading 'Our Services'. Below it, create a **4-column grid** (e.g., using `row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-4 g-4` on the `div.row`). Each column should contain a Bootstrap card.
    > 1.  **Card 1:** Title: 'DevOps & Automation'. Description: 'We build and streamline CI/CD pipelines, automate infrastructure, and foster a culture of collaboration to accelerate your development lifecycle.'
    > 2.  **Card 2:** Title: 'Cloud Architecture'. Description: 'Designing and implementing robust, secure, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure on AWS, Azure, or GCP to meet your scaling needs.'
    > 3.  **Card 3:** Title: 'Distributed Systems'. Description: 'Expert guidance on architecting and managing complex distributed applications, ensuring high availability and resilience.'
    > 4.  **Card 4:** Title: **'AI/ML Solutions'**. Description: **'Leveraging machine learning models and AI-driven automation to unlock new insights, enhance efficiency, and create intelligent applications.'**"

#### Phase 2: Credibility and Contact Sections

**Goal:** Build the sections that establish trust and provide a clear way to get in touch.

*   **Substep 2.1: Portfolio Section**
    > **Prompt:** "Create a new `<section>` with the `id="portfolio"`, a light background color (`bg-light`), and padding (`py-5`). Add a container with a heading 'Our Work'. Inside, create a responsive grid of portfolio items using Bootstrap cards. Each card should have a placeholder for an image, a project title (e.g., 'Cloud-Native Platform for a FinTech Startup' or 'ML-Powered Recommendation Engine'), and a short description of the project."

*   **Substep 2.2: About Section**
    > **Prompt:** "Create a new `<section>` with `id="about"` and padding (`py-5`). Inside, create a container with a two-column layout.
    > *   **Left Column:** A heading 'Our Mission' and a paragraph about your company's goal to empower businesses through technology and robust infrastructure.
    > *   **Right Column:** A heading 'Our Approach' and a paragraph describing your consulting methodology. Write all content using 'we' and 'our'."

*   **Substep 2.3: Contact Section & Form**
    > **Prompt:** "Create the final content `<section>` with `id="contact"` and padding (`py-5`). This section should have a dark background (`bg-dark`) and white text. Inside its container, add a heading 'Contact Us'. Then, create a simple HTML form that submits to your Formspree URL. The form should have fields for 'Full Name', 'Company Email', and 'Message'. Use Bootstrap 5 form styling. **Do not add any custom JavaScript for form validation.**"

#### Phase 3: Functionality, Styling, and Finalization

**Goal:** Implement the JavaScript for smooth scrolling, apply custom branding, and test everything.

*   **Substep 3.1: Add Smooth Scrolling and Active Nav Highlighting**
    > **Prompt:** "Create a new `js/scripts.js` file. Add vanilla JavaScript to implement smooth scrolling for all links with the `js-scroll-trigger` class. Then, add Bootstrap's Scrollspy functionality to the `<body>` tag to automatically update the active link in the navigation bar as the user scrolls through the sections. The `target` for the Scrollspy should be `#mainNav`."

*   **Substep 3.2: Custom Styling**
    > **Prompt:** "In `css/style.css`, let's customize the design to create a unique brand identity.
    > 1.  Create a CSS variable for a new primary color, such as a professional blue (`--bs-primary: #0d6efd;`) or a tech-focused green (`--bs-primary: #198754;`), to replace the default yellow.
    > 2.  Override the default font. Use a modern, clean sans-serif font like 'Inter' or 'Lato' for the body text by importing it from Google Fonts.
    > 3.  Add a hover effect to the service and portfolio cards to make them lift slightly (`transform: translateY(-5px);`)."

*   **Substep 3.3: Final Review and Testing**
    > **Prompt:** "Review the `index.html` file.
    > 1.  Check that all navigation links scroll smoothly to the correct section.
    > 2.  Verify that the Scrollspy is working and the nav links are highlighted correctly as you scroll.
    > 3.  Test the contact form to ensure submissions are sent to your email.
    > 4.  Check the website on different screen sizes to ensure it is fully responsive."
